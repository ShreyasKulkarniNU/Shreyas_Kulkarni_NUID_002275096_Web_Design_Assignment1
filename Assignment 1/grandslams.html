            Players hit a ball over a net and try to win points. The one who wins more points wins the match. The player or team that wins the whole tournament gets a big trophy and a lot of money.

        <p style="padding:2%">Wimbledon is like a super fancy tennis party that happens in England. It's one of the most famous tennis tournaments in the world, and it's kind of a big deal.

            Imagine this: there's a beautiful grassy lawn, and all the best tennis players from around the world come to play there. They wear crisp white outfits, and the audience sips on tea and eats strawberries with cream while watching the matches.
            
            Wimbledon is different because they play on grass courts, which is quite special. It's like playing tennis on a well-manicured lawn.
            
            There are men's and women's singles matches, doubles matches (two players on each side of the court), and even a mixed doubles event where men and women play together.
            
            The players try to hit the ball over the net and win points. If they win enough points, they win the match. The player or team that wins the whole tournament gets a shiny trophy, and it's a big honor in the tennis world.
            
            People all over the world watch Wimbledon on TV, and some lucky folks get to watch the matches in person at the famous Wimbledon stadium. It's a bit like a tennis fairytale with a touch of British elegance.</p>

            The US Open is famous for playing on hard courts, which are like playing on a really firm surface, kind of like a sidewalk. It's different from the grass courts at Wimbledon.
