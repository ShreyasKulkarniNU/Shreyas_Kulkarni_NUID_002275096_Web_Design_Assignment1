Favicon - I have used the <link rel="icon"> tag, commonly known as the "favicon" tag, is used in HTML to specify the small icon or image that appears in the browser tab when someone visits a website.

Form - I used the form tag to get tennis players inquires.  The <form> tag in HTML is like a container or a box where you put different elements like text fields, buttons, and checkboxes to create things like contact forms, search bars, or surveys on a website. When you fill out these forms and click a button like "Submit," the information you entered is sent to a server for processing, like sending an email or searching for something on the internet. So, the <form> tag helps make all these interactive things on websites possible.

It's a way to make websites interactive and allows users to perform actions with a simple click, like pushing a real-world button.

audio - I used it for tennis music.  The <audio> tag in HTML is like a built-in music or sound player for web pages. It allows you to embed audio files (like music tracks, podcasts, or sound effects) directly into a webpage so that visitors can listen to them. It's similar to having a small radio or music player on a website. You can control the playback, volume, and other settings to create an audio experience for your website visitors without needing an external player or app.

<details> is like a container that can be expanded or collapsed.
<summary> is like a label or title for that container.
When the webpage loads, the content within the <details> element is initially hidden. Users can click on the <summary> element, and it acts like a toggle switch, revealing or hiding the content within the <details> container. This can be useful for creating expandable sections of content on a webpage, such as FAQ sections where users can click to reveal answers to questions.	

menu -  <menu> tag in HTML has been deprecated and is not commonly used in modern web development. It was introduced in HTML5 but has limited support in browsers, and its functionality has largely been superseded by other HTML elements and CSS for creating menus and navigation.
